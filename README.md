# Texture Overlayer



Texture Overlayer (formerly Penumbra Image Manipulation Plugin or pimp for short), is designed to replace the need for baking texture mods in either Penumbra or GIMP/Photoshop

You'll use a Penumbra Texture Editor-esque UI to define texture layers which get combined to make your final product.
Layers are enabled and disabled based upon the current mod status and setting.
You can configure multiple textures to replace, the primary use-case being skin textures but can be used for clothing textures as well.

This project wouldn't be possible without these projects, they have my greatest thanks.

## To do

* Texture combining and caching
  * Cache texture hashes rather than generating and comparing at plugin start
* Main UI
  * More robust layer controls
  * Implementing double click to rename layer
* Penumbra Texture Selector
  * Implement the VFXEditor selection method of selecting mods so users can what settings are associated with a texture
